[Meta] Chapter Reader
=====================

A hybrid userscript that creates a simple UI for manga sites to read full chapters.

It makes use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Yek.js](http://passcod.net/yek.js)
as well as HTML5 technologies to achieve a modern look. As a hybrid userscript, it
injects itself into the page and thus forsakes advanced chrome privileges. As such,
it may appear bulky, but it has the advantage of being completely self-contained
and therefore has very few plugin dependencies: any Greasemonkey-compatible plugin
can use it, provided the underlying browser is modern enough to render its UI.

Adapters
--------

MCR is divided into the 'core' and an 'adapter'. The core contains the UI, UX,
and implements the base logic. The adapter contains the chapter logic: it queries
the target website for:

 * Information about the manga we want to read (author, description, etc)
 * __URLs of the images for each page for the wanted chapter__ (required)
 * A list of all manga available on the site (optionally)

Using that architecture, we'll be able to easily create and maintain adapters for
many different manga sites and still have that uniform experience across all.

Libraries used
--------------

 * __Yek.js__: A simple hotkey library
 * __Storage.js__: A thin wrapper around localStorage for easier access
 * __jQuery__: No description needed :)

Make details
------------

`make`ing the project notably requires a PHP5 CLI install on your PATH
(called using `php`). It also requires a Java runtime (either Sun/Oracle
or OpenJDK) to run Google's Closure Compiler.
