MR.net Chapter Reader
=====================

A hybrid userscript that creates a simple UI for [MR.net](http://mangareader.net)
to read full chapters. Has several options to customize it to your convenience.

It makes use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Yek.js](http://passcod.net/yek.js)
as well as HTML5 technologies to achieve a modern look. As a hybrid userscript, it
injects itself into the page and thus forsakes advanced chrome privileges. As such,
it may appear bulky, but it has the advantage of being completely self-contained
and therefore has very few plugin dependencies: any Greasemonkey-compatible plugin
can use it, provided the underlying browser is modern enough to render its UI.

Libraries used
--------------

 * __Yek.js__: A simple hotkey library
 * __Storage.js__: A thin wrapper around localStorage for easier access
 * __jQuery__: No description needed :)

Make details
------------

`make`ing the project notably requires a working web connection (to download the
above libraries) and a PHP5 CLI install on your PATH (called using `php`). It also
requires a Java runtime (either Sun/Oracle or OpenJDK) to run Google's Closure
Compiler.
